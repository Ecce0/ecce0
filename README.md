## About Me 🚀

I'm an AWS Cloud Engineer transitioning into **Product Management**, bringing hands-on experience with Node.js, React.js, Terraform, and AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, VPCs, CloudWatch). My technical background helps me bridge the gap between engineering teams and business goals: I understand what's possible, what's practical, and how to build products that scale sustainably.
I'm drawn to **product management** because I love the strategic side of technology: understanding user needs, translating them into features, and guiding products from concept to launch. I recently earned my CSPO certification and have been working with Agile methodologies, sprint planning, and backlog management for 5 years, gaining insight from a developer's perspective..

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Terraform + Agile Product Discovery + Hitchiti**
- 🔭 Working on: **The Relocation Calculation App (solving a real problem I'm experiencing)**
- 💡 Special Interest: **AI Ethics and Governance in product development; the art of applying Agile Methodologies to any plan or goal**
- 📫 How to reach me: **ecollier871@outlook.com**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I'm ambidextrous; I love going to concerts and festivals**

**The Relocation Calculation App** is a serverless web application that solves a real problem I've experienced: comparing salaries and cost-of-living across 214 U.S. cities to make informed relocation decisions. Built with **React, Node.js, AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB), and Terraform**, this project showcases both my technical capabilities and product thinking—defining user needs, prioritizing features, and iterating based on feedback.

This is my hands-on way of learning product management: I'm the engineer, the PM, and the user. I manage the backlog in GitHub Projects, write user stories, and make trade-off decisions between scope, timeline, and technical complexity. It's not production ready yet, but you can follow my journey as I build in public. Check out the repository for the Cloud Engineer perspective [here](https://github.com/Ecce0/AIRelocationApp/tree/dev) and from the Product Owner role [here](https://github.com/Ecce0/AIRelocationApp/wiki).
